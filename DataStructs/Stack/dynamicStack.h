/*
    This implementation is built on linked list instead of an array. A linked listâ€“based stack 
    offers two advantages over an array-based stack. First, there is no need to specify the starting 
    size of the stack. A dynamic stack simply starts as an empty linked list, then expands by one node 
    each time a value is pushed. Second, a dynamic stack will never be full, as long as the system has 
    enough free memory.
